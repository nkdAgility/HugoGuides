## Module Overview

This module enables organizations and communities to deliver guides in multiple languages, support multiple versions, and manage several guides from a single platform.

It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static site, which can be deployed anywhere (such as Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting provider).

### Translation Flexibility

- You can provide PDF-only translations for any guide or version, allowing for translated content even if a full web version is not available.
- Individual versions of a guide can be translated independently, without requiring other versions or other guides to be translated as well.

Da Guide 1 Booky (Joo-ly 2020)

Workie-work not same anymore! Long ago, minion go to big building, sit on butt, and press button. Now? Boop boop on laptop from home! Technology say “HELLO!” and work say “BYE OFFICE!”

Dis essay talkie ‘bout how tech make worky weird, fun, crazy, and different.

## 1. BYE OFFICE, HELLO LAPTOP

Before: boss say “come here,” and minion walk walk to job. Now: boss on screen, minion in bed, coffee in hand. Zoom, Slack, Teamy-team... all da tool for talky-talk with frens across da world. Even when cough-cough pandemic hit, work say “we go online!”

No need bossy eye watchy all time. Now boss say “you give me da thing” and minion say “OK” from sofa. Trust go up. Pants go down. Much better!

## 2. ROBOT DO BORING STUFF

Machine no sleep. AI do job fast fast. It click, it think, it do math. Minion no need count paper or send invite. Chatbot say “HELLO CUSTOMER” and human say “nap time!”

But some minion go “uh oh… robot take job?” And yes, sometimes, robot take da easy-peasy task. So big boss need think ‘bout privacy, fairness, and not making bad robot do bad thing.

## 3. SMARTY MINION TIME

Now job no need big muscle, need big brain! Thinky-think, fixy-fix, learny-learn. Use Google! Make chart! Clickety-click!

Internet is da office now. And minion must keep learning or go “BYE JOB.” New skills = more bananas. Online school, fast certifikato, learning never stop.

## 4. NO MORE BOSS TOWER

Old way: big boss say “do this!” New way: team say “let’s do this together!” Kanban! DevOps! Agile! Sound like food, but is tool for speedy work!

Minions try thing, fail, laugh, try again. It’s messy. It’s noisy. It’s fun! Team go “YAY US” when thing works. Everyone share da boom and da bust.

## 5. WORK AND LIFE IN A SMOOSH

Used to be: work here, fun there. Now it’s all mixy-mix. Zoom call, then feed dog. Email, then eat cookie. But… brain say “I no can rest!”

So smart bosses say “take break,” “don’t message at night,” and “mental health important.” Good minion want job that care, not just money.

## 6. ALL MINIONS WELCOME

Internet let all da minions play! Big, small, near, far. Remote job mean people from jungle or moon can join team. Tech help blind minion read, or French minion understand English.

But... robot brain sometimes unfair. It copy bad human. So team must fix rules, help all voices talk, and make sure no one get “SHHHHH’d.”

## 7. FUTURE: SO MUCH WOW

Soon, minion work in space goggles! Touch air, move files. Maybe job in metaverse? Maybe robot friend sit next to you?

But change come fast. Must learn again. Must flex brain. Governments must wake up and fix da school, tax, and job rule.

## THE BIG FINISH

Technology no just tool. It’s a tornado of change! It help fast, smart, fair work—but also bring trouble if not careful.

So bossy-boss must use brain and heart. Mix speed with care. Make sure no minion left behind. Da future of work? It’s here. It’s NOW. It’s super digital!

BANANA.
